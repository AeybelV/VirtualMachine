# NoNameLang

NoName is a programming language that I have written as a educational experience and interesting side project for me. I have called it NoName simply because I couldn't think of a name, but I will do so in the future.

The language compiles source files into the NoNameLang bytecode, which is then run on the NoNameLang Virtual Machine, which is the runtime for executing NoNameLang bytecode. The NNVM is designed to be a stack based machine.

Currently the compiler is a work in progress. The compiler can read a file passed to it on the command line and prints out tokens. I will also get to work on the runtime soon. A test file called "test.nn" can be read by the compiler.
